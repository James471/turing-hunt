# Turing Hunt

Roam the halls and roads of the campus without worrying about social distancing, ticket costs and endsems, looking for clues and solving puzzles to get a chance[ยน](#tc1) to have tea with eminent scientists!

We know that some people may not have a stable internet connection, so the whole game is offline. (The actual reason is that online games are harder to make, but lets go with the socially aware reason :P) You can however use the internet to solve the clues!

The event starts at **9pm on Saturday 20th June**. Play time should be around 3 hours.
_Those who cannot make it on that day can also play it at any later time_

Turing Club hopes to make this an annual event, much like other Treasure Hunts, so we'll keep adding features every year! We really hope that you all participate and make this a success!

## Rules

- Though technically a single-player game, you can always play with your friends. This game is best served with a side of a video call with your friends.
- You are allowed to use the internet, but a constant internet connection is not necessary
- **You cannot save the game, so do not close the game during play, or you will have to start all over again**
- Game play is relatively easy.
  - Use `ls` or `search` to look around for clues and other helpful items
  - Use `goto location name` or `cd location name` to move to connecting locations
  - Use `map` to open up the map. _Note that as you collect more items, new locations open up!_
  - Use `pocket` to view a list of items collected. _This is very helpful if you get stuck._
- Some clues have an image component or a file that needs to be copied somewhere.
- At the end of the game, your time and roll number will be registered in a google sheet. This will require an internet connection. This is obviously not mandatory if you don't mind losing an opportunity to have tea.
